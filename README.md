# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

api for weather
There are several APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) available for accessing weather data. Here are a few popular ones:

OpenWeatherMap API: OpenWeatherMap is a popular provider of weather data, and they offer a free API that developers can use to access current weather data, weather forecasts, and historical weather data.

Weather Underground API: Weather Underground provides weather data for over 250,000 locations worldwide, and they offer a REST API that developers can use to access current weather conditions, forecasts, and historical weather data.

Dark Sky API: Dark Sky is a popular weather app that provides hyperlocal weather forecasts. They offer a paid API that developers can use to access their weather data, which includes forecasts, current conditions, and historical data.

AccuWeather API: AccuWeather provides weather data for over 2.3 million locations worldwide. They offer a REST API that developers can use to access current weather conditions, forecasts, and historical data.

WeatherAPI.com: WeatherAPI.com is a popular weather API that provides current weather data, forecasts, and historical weather data. They offer both free and paid plans for developers.

These APIs typically require developers to sign up for an API key, which is used to authenticate API requests. Once authenticated, developers can use the API to retrieve weather data in various formats such as JSON or XML.




Юрий Параска
can you write me links?
Certainly! Here are the links to the APIs mentioned in my previous response:

OpenWeatherMap API: https://openweathermap.org/api
Weather Underground API: https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api
Dark Sky API: https://darksky.net/dev
AccuWeather API: https://developer.accuweather.com/apis
WeatherAPI.com: https://www.weatherapi.com/
Note that some of these APIs may require developers to create an account and obtain an API key before they can access the data. The documentation for each API should provide more information on how to get started.




Юрий Параска
OpenWeatherMap API is it free?
Yes, OpenWeatherMap API offers a free plan that allows developers to access weather data for up to 60 calls per minute and up to 1,000,000 calls per month. The free plan also includes access to current weather data, weather forecasts, and historical weather data for any location in the world.

However, note that the free plan has some limitations, such as a lower frequency of updates, less accuracy in data, and fewer data points than the paid plans. Additionally, the free plan does not provide access to some of the advanced features, such as satellite imagery or historical data going back more than 5 years.

If you need more advanced features or higher call limits, you can consider upgrading to one of OpenWeatherMap's paid plans. Their paid plans offer higher call limits, more data points, and additional features such as bulk downloads and custom weather alerts.

can you creat request from OpenWeatherMap in react 
Sure, here's an example of how you can create a request to the OpenWeatherMap API in React using the built-in fetch function:

javascript
Copy code
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Weather() {
  const [weatherData, setWeatherData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key
    const apiURL = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY`;

    fetch(apiURL)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setWeatherData(data))
      .catch(error => console.log(error));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {weatherData ? (
        <div>
          <h2>Current Weather in {weatherData.name}</h2>
          <p>Temperature: {weatherData.main.temp} K</p>
          <p>Humidity: {weatherData.main.humidity}</p>
          <p>Weather: {weatherData.weather[0].description}</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading weather data...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Weather;
In this example, we're using the useState hook to create a state variable called weatherData to store the weather data we receive from the API. We're using the useEffect hook to fetch the weather data from the API when the component mounts.

Once we receive the data, we're updating the weatherData state variable with the received data and rendering the temperature, humidity, and weather description in the component.

Note that you need to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key in the apiURL variable in order for this code to work.

I tryed your code, but I see error 401
If you're seeing a 401 error when using the OpenWeatherMap API, it means that your API key is not valid or has expired. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

Double-check that you're using the correct API key. You can check your API key by logging into your OpenWeatherMap account and going to the "API Keys" section.

Make sure that your API key is included in the API request URL. You can check this by logging the apiURL variable to the console before making the API request.

Verify that your API key has the necessary permissions to access the data you're requesting. For example, if you're trying to access historical weather data, make sure that your API key has access to historical data.

Check if you've exceeded your API request limits. OpenWeatherMap's free plan has a limit of 60 API calls per minute and 1,000,000 API calls per month. If you exceed these limits, you may see a 401 error.

If you've checked all of these steps and are still seeing a 401 error, you may need to contact OpenWeatherMap's support team for further assistance.

can you create one more time request weather in my town, vinogradovo zakarpatskaya oblast'
Sure, here's an example of how to create a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather data for Vinogradovo, Zakarpatska Oblast, Ukraine:

javascript
Copy code
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Weather() {
  const [weatherData, setWeatherData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key
    const apiURL = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Vinogradovo,Zakarpatska Oblast,UA&appid=YOUR_API_KEY`;

    fetch(apiURL)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setWeatherData(data))
      .catch(error => console.log(error));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {weatherData ? (
        <div>
          <h2>Current Weather in {weatherData.name}</h2>
          <p>Temperature: {weatherData.main.temp} K</p>
          <p>Humidity: {weatherData.main.humidity}</p>
          <p>Weather: {weatherData.weather[0].description}</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading weather data...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Weather;
In this example, we're using the q parameter in the API URL to specify the location of Vinogradovo, Zakarpatska Oblast, Ukraine. Note that the location should be entered as "City Name, State/Province Code, Country Code".

Make sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key for this code to work.




Юрий Параска
i see error, I think you did mistake
I apologize if there was an error in the code I provided. Here's an updated example that should work:

javascript
Copy code
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Weather() {
  const [weatherData, setWeatherData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key
    const apiURL = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Vinogradovo,Zakarpats'ka oblast,UA&appid=YOUR_API_KEY`;

    fetch(apiURL)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setWeatherData(data))
      .catch(error => console.log(error));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {weatherData ? (
        <div>
          <h2>Current Weather in {weatherData.name}</h2>
          <p>Temperature: {weatherData.main.temp} K</p>
          <p>Humidity: {weatherData.main.humidity}</p>
          <p>Weather: {weatherData.weather[0].description}</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading weather data...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Weather;
In this updated example, I corrected the spelling of Zakarpats'ka oblast to match the correct spelling in the OpenWeatherMap API.

Make sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key for this code to work. If you're still experiencing issues, please let me know what error message you're seeing so I can assist you further.
